                    <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My coding adventure started in my first year at university. 
                        I feel like I love this job. Although this long and difficult journey will tire my mind,
                        I take the risk and believe that I will embrace this job. 
                        Although I am not even 20 years old, I cannot stop my desire to learn and I hope it will not stop and continue like this.
                        I am making this simple website for promotional purposes, I am still in the learning phase, date 31.07.2024. 
                        Thank you for reading up to this point.</p>
                    <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I don't have any confirmed experience because I'm still a student.</p>
                    <p> I'm currently training myself at a software agency called abratech, watching videos and trying to understand the logic.</p>
                    <p>I'm a sophomore and I hope I can take myself to better places before I finish university.</p>

                    <h5>What I Know ?</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I received Java training in the first year of university.</p>
                    <p>Apart from that, I completed Python training from BTK Academy and received a certificate.</p>
                    <p>I am currently trying to master creating a website using Python and Django, which I am still developing myself.</p>
                    <p>After these are finished, I will start developing mobile applications. I want to step into the gaming industry.</p>

                    <h5>How I Learn </h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>If you talk about Java, I tried to progress from Udemy training outside of university and always tried to stay ahead.</p>
                    <p>I usually try to learn by watching videos, changing the examples in the videos and practicing by associating the logic with myself.</p>
                    <p>When I get stuck, I try to solve the problem by searching on the internet and asking for help from my friends.</p>

                    <h5> My Short Term Goals</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This is a kind of note to myself hahaha but okay.</p>
                    <p>In the short term, I want to see myself as an individual who has developed in web design and web construction. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, I want to move on to the game and mobile application sections, provided that I am successful in my university courses and my social life is not disrupted.</p>
